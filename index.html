        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zmR5dtx0I3ud7KzkVkOE4KYHcpBiBh9V/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Download</a> Big sales data (5M rows! 600+MB)</li>
        <li><a href="example/recordssm.csv" target="_blank">Small version</a> of the big data 10000 records</li>
        <li>Good attitude towards learning and some homework</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What will I learn?</h2>
      <p>You can expect to learn basic programming with Python and use Python Pandas to clean, prepare and analyse data. Students will use the Titanic data set to determine if women and children really did get on the life boats first. Students will also indulge their creativity by writing out their analysis to a graphical web page with an SVG graphic. Their Python generated web analysis will be hosted on Github and distributed to the WWW using free Github Pages. Finally, students will be introduced to a big dataset of 5 million sales records to demonstrate how Python and Pandas can quickly analyse data too big for a spreadsheet program.</p>

        <p>Great to meet 8 wonderful students from around the world! Special thanks to Elva for getting up at 6 to be with us from the Mountain time zone in North America :-) Also, thanks to Aaron, William and KC for their excellent participation. Today we learned the basics of data types, variables, data type casting using int() and str(). Basic math operations and string concatenation was introduced. We also learned about using built in Python functions like print(), round() and input(). Finally, we built a short program using if, elif, else statements to receive data from a user and send them back information based on their input.</p>
        <p>I look forward to seeing your upgrades to the simple program we made today in tomorrow's class.</p>

        <h4>Objecives</h4>
        <p>In this class, you can expect to review functions, lists and looping in Python. You will also learn how to use file input and out in Python and work with our titanic dataset. You will also learn the 3 categories of errors you will encounter when programming (syntax, run time and logic).</p>

        </ul>
        <h4>Teacher summary</h4>
        <p>Today we did quite a bit of review using the Python shell. Afterwards we got to work and finally got to play with the Titanic data. We learned how to open, use readlines() to transfer file data into a list and close the file. We also learned how to explore the data by using list indexes. Lastly we created a custom function to pass in a list and a number and print out data. We were able to use the .split() function to convert our string data into a temporary list and create better output for our users. If any of this is confusing, please contact me (mdjhoel@gmail.com).</p>
        <p>I'd like to recognize our super participants: <b>Aaron, KC and William</b> today. I encourage everyone to get involved, ask questions and make mistakes. We are a friend community and participating is the best way to learn.</p>

        <h4>Objecives</h4>
        <p>In this class, you can expect to review file input, for loops and functions. New topics include how to use a game loop (while) and the input() function to create a user interface. You can also expect to learn how to create an algorithm to calculate the number of kids that survived the Titanic disaster.</p>

        </ul>
        <h4>Teacher summary</h4>
        <p>We started with a Python shell review of the split() built in function and defining and calling functions. The main event was opening the titanic.csv file and building an algorithm to determine the number of kids (under 16) that survived the tragedy. Our algorithm was pretty straight forward, but implementing it in Python required multiple steps of debugging and making sure all our data types worked well together.</p>
        <p>I want to thank all the superstar code debuggers and uber participants today. Shout outs to <b>Aaron, KC, William, Daniel and Sam</b>.</p>

New topics include creaing an general algorithm to solve the question of Women and Children first. Finally, we will add a game loop (while) and the input() function to create a user interface. </p>

        </ul>
        <h4>Teacher summary</h4>
        <p>A good week of classes learning Python and coding basics was concluding with answering our data science question: Was it women and children first on the titanic? According to our algoithms (74%, 59%, 19%) it certainly seems that way. That said, <b>Aaron</b> brought up a good point when he noticed that we were not excluding children (which we defined as < 16) from our analysis of women and men and the fact that there is missing data in the database. All in all, I would call the week and Day 5 a success. Lot of good questions and comments from <b>Aaron, William, KC and Daniel</b> (who stayed behind for help fixing his code - bravo!). Anyway, make sure you contact me (mdjhoel@gmail.com) if you are too shy to speak in class and need help.

In the end we were able to introduce Pandas and show it working and all students were able to do this. If you are unable to download the big file due to VPN or Google blocking issues, use this link to the file on <a href="https://file.io/ejKUwdWUNvCc" target="_blank">file.io</a>. Many thanks to Aaron, Daniel, and KC for excellent participation today. HOMEWORK: update your index.html with cool CSS styles and upload it to Github.
